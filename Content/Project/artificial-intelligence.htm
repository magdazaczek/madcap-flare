        <h1>Artificial intelligence</h1>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.Introduction">The popularity of artificial intelligence (AI) surged with the introduction of ChatGPT. However, AI had already begun making its mark in various aspects of our lives long before we heard about ChatGPT for the first time.</p>
        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence" alt="The definition of AI on the IBM page">IBM</a> summarizes AI as:</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.Definition"><i>Artificial intelligence (AI) is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, decision making, creativity and autonomy.</i>
        </p>
        <p>AI can be divided into many categories, for example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Interactive AI (chatbots, smart personal assistants).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Functional AI (robots).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Analytical AI (analysis, supplier risk assessment).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Text AI (text recognition, speech-to-text conversion).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Visual AI (computer vision, augmented reality).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As an example, let's take a look at an image that <span class="bold">Copilot AI</span> generated for the following command -<i> "Generate a picture that contrasts remote work and office work"</i>. </p>
