        <p MadCap:conditions="General.Introduction">For many people, working <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="New Glossary.Term1">remotely</MadCap:glossaryTerm> is a dream come true. The popularity of 100% remote positions appeared, of course, during the pandemic time. Many workplaces weren't ready for such a working model, but there was no choice. </p>
        <p>After the pandemic time, some companies decided to close their offices and switch to 100% remote work. </p>
        <p>People are interested in remote positions for various reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>They don't want to commute to work and waste time.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>They can save more money because they don't have to buy bus tickets or fuel their cars so often.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>They feel more comfortable working from their home.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>They often are flexible to set their own working hours, which is a big benefit for people who have children.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
